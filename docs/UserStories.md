This document captures user stories that drive feature development. User stories are reverse-engineered from completed epics and updated as new features are planned.

**Document Structure**
- Active stories: This file (`docs/UserStories.md`)
- Implementation tracking: `docs/ToDos.md` (epics and tasks)
- Completed work: `docs/CompletedTasks.md`

**Format:** Each story follows the standard template:
> As a [persona], I want [capability] so that [benefit].

## Story Template

```markdown
#### US-XXX: [Short Title]

> As a **[persona]**, I want **[capability]** so that **[benefit]**.

**Completed:** [Date or "Planned"]
```

## Relationship to Epics

User stories capture the **why** (user need and benefit). Epics capture the **what** (technical implementation tasks).

| Artifact | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| User Story | Business/user need | `docs/UserStories.md` |
| Epic | Implementation scope | `docs/ToDos.md` |
| Task | Technical work item | Nested in epic YAML |
| Acceptance Criteria | Definition of done | In user story |

**Workflow:**
1. Identify user need -> Create user story
2. Design solution -> Create epic with tasks
3. Implement -> Work through tasks via `/nextTask` and `/implement`
4. Complete -> Mark epic complete, update story status
